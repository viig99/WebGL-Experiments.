My WebGl Experiments
====================

This will contain my webGl experiments as per [these tutorials](http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?page_id=1217) but using a different non-global-poluting style.

The Square Color is the base Color taken from [here](http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/1945976).

Added Animation to the Experiment and learnt why to save the matrix state during matrix operations.

Introduced 3d elements to the scene using drawElements.

###	TODO

*	Wrap glMatrix under a namespace.
* 	Move to Tutorial 5.
